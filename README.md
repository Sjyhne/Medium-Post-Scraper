# Medium Post Scraper
Project for getting the medium posts with the most claps for a specific time range, and possibly provide some metrics for the posts retrieved.

## Approach
1. Being able to scrape the most clapped posts for a specific day and provide the Title, Author, Number of claps, and Url - OK
2. Set up an automatic scraping job for each day and deliver the results through mail
3. Being able to specify the date of scraping through an api or webinterface
4. Being able to retreive the most clapped posts for a range of time
5. Add metrics or statistics for the last 7 days or similar

Should probably create an api for the service. Either for on demand scraping jobs for specific day and maybe ranges of days??? and able to add their email as a subscriber to the daily delivery of yesterdays top articles.

Should probably also deploy it as a docker container to a server, raspberry pi ...??

Need to start brainstorming possible machine learning utilization?

## Brainstorming??

MACHINE LEARNING?


## CURRENTLY WORKING ON:

I've now decided to create a Flask and ReactJS application for the project, might be overkill, but I need to brush up on webdevelopment skills
